### Please cite our paper if you used this code.

## Build from Souce
### Mac/Linux
The project comes with an sbt launcher script. With this script, you don't need to have sbt installed. First, clone the git repo, using the following command: 
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/qadahtm/webui/tree/tornado-ui
```
Next, build the project using:
```sh
$ ./sbt pack
```
Scripts for launching the executables will be available in `./target/pack/bin` directory.

To run the webserver: 
```sh
$ ./target/pack/bin/TornadoUI
```

In the browser, open `http://localhost:9990/newui.htm`


## Setting up eclipse
The project is already configured to generate Eclipse project files in order to utilize Eclipse as the IDE.

Simply, run 
```sh
$ ./sbt eclipse
```

Then import project from the Eclipse menu (i.e. File -> Import...)
